This project is part of Module 9 Challenge of Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

## Project Description
### Problem
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. 

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. 

### Files Supplied 
Six csv files  

### Deliverables
1. A sketch of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the six tables using a tool such QuickDBD.
2. Create a table schema for each csv file by specifying data types, foreign keys, primary keys and other constraints.
3. Import each csv file into the SQL database and conduct an analysis.
