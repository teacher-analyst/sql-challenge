# sql-challenge

For this project, I have designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. 

This repository consists of a folder containing six csv files. an image file of the Entity Relationship Diagram, the table schemata that was exported from QUICK DBD and query file consisting of SQL.
